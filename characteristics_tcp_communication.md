TCP is **Connection-Oriented**, **Reliable**, **Flow Control**, the transport layer protocol.

- Connection-Oriented: It's a two-way connection, connected through a three-way handshake and disconnected through a
four-way wave.

- Reliable: If errors are detected in the transmitted data, it will be discarded, and the receiver will request a retransmission.

- Flow Control: Prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once.
